# census-form-learning
This is a census form project that I worked on while learning the basics of javaScript and HTML forms. 
It consists of several exercises, such as:
-displaying messages in console when fields are empty after submitting, and specifying which of the first 3 have not been filled.
-displaying in console the first name (onkeyup)
-displaying the gender and education level after clicking on the button
-displaying the special mentions value in console only if length > 50 characters
-showing an error message in console if the first or last name fields contain numbers (onchange)
