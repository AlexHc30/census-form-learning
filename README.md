# Census form
<h3>This is a census form project that I worked on while learning the basics of javaScript and HTML forms.</h3>

It consists of several exercises, such as:<br>
* displaying error messages on the page after submitting:<br>
	* when one of the first 3 fields are empty and specifying which ones have not been filled.<br>
	* if the first or last name fields contain numbers (onchange)<br>
* displaying in console after submitting:
	* gender and education level, if they are filled in.
	* special mentions value, only if length > 50 characters.
* opening dialog after clicking on navigation links in the footer, with yes/no buttons. Dialog closes after clicking one of them.
* CSS: practiced mobile responsiveness, creating a footer that sticks to the bottom of the screen and others. <br>
