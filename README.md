# census-form-learning
<h3>This is a census form project that I worked on while learning the basics of javaScript and HTML forms.</h3>

It consists of several exercises, such as:<br>
-displaying messages in console when fields are empty after submitting, and specifying which of the first 3 have not been filled.<br>
-displaying in console the first name (onkeyup)<br>
-displaying the gender and education level after clicking on the button<br>
-displaying the special mentions value in console only if length > 50 characters<br>
-showing an error message in console if the first or last name fields contain numbers (onchange)
